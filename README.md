# ICU-LOS-Length-of-Stay-Predictive-Modelling-for-patients-with-Spinal-Injury
Drawing from the MIMIC IV dataset to produce insight on how long a patient with an acute spinal injury would spend in an Intensive Care Unit. 
ICU's are often expensive to operate and require heavy oversight and management from hopsital staff and resources, so these predictions would help control hospital expensive, provide patients with more timely discharges and optimize hospital resource management.
