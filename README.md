# ICU-LOS-Length-of-Stay-Predictive-Modelling-for-patients-with-Spinal-Injury
Drawing from the MIMIC IV dataset to produce insight on how long a patient with an acute spinal injury would spend in an Intensive Care Unit. 
ICU's are often expensive to operate and require heavy oversight and management from hopsital staff and resources, so these predictions would help control hospital expensive, provide patients with more timely discharges and optimize hospital resource management.

Below details the contents of each uploaded file.

## Project Proposal.pdf:
Provides insight into:
- Research purpose and benefits
- Using a singular, general machine learning model over using multiple for niche patient subgroups, and versus using both.
- Details on the dataset done through EDA such as the size, missing values, data collection, relevant variables to the investigation from each csv file (as MIMIC IV has multiple datasets within itself) and feature engineering that would be useful in the endeavour.
- Discussing the visualizations to use to best capture the insights from EDA and model metrics.
- Potential models and statistical tools to use prior to the start of the investigation such as Causal Inference or Nueral Networks and both the pros & cons of such.
- The final method that was used to carry out the investigation.
- Concerns to keep in mind such as the quality of the dataset as a whole or technical challenges such as using different SQL-based techniques to acquire the data needed and whether these techniques would be optimal or not.
